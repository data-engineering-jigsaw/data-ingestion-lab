We calculate our ridesharing\ncategory position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of\ntotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a\ngiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly\navailable information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of\nthe world where  we operate.  We also  participate  in certain  regions through  our minority-owned  affiliates.  At the  time  of entering  into  such transactions,  we\nbelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading\nridesharing category position in its respective market.\nDelivery\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal\ndelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched\nour Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery\nenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands\nthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our\nplatform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we\nbelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-\nhouse expenses.\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The\nacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly\nGroup, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The\nacquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item\n8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFreight\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing\nindustries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry\nis highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the\nprocess conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is\nequally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These\ninefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n4\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate\nand accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end.", "start_char_idx": 13707, "end_char_idx": 18622, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "519a0736-e7a1-4a26-835f-d8051ce9093f": {"__data__": {"id_": "519a0736-e7a1-4a26-835f-d8051ce9093f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "329126be-b962-4bfa-857f-f988be4a0518", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "911c389da7c38a9c076dc5d13841c320df6541600fd3d1d900b0e55607e19dc4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "924336aa-9bab-4669-ae24-25711834d803", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cead37c70f5681140693885b91ef0feb9b683ad27c9223c5685009f8e8c400a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The freight industry\nis highly fragmented and deeply inefficient.

Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate\nand accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing\nand the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,\nsecure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent\nsignificant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Together, these elements power\nmovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and\ncarriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.\nIn approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a\nbutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.\nLeading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our\ndeep  technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Our\ntechnologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.\nOperational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale\nproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide\nplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and\ntrust.\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience,  enabling us to attract new platform  users and to deepen engagement  with existing\nplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on\naverage, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United\nStates as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority\nservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in\nselect cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our\nconsumers.", "start_char_idx": 17780, "end_char_idx": 22889, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "924336aa-9bab-4669-ae24-25711834d803": {"__data__": {"id_": "924336aa-9bab-4669-ae24-25711834d803", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "519a0736-e7a1-4a26-835f-d8051ce9093f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db6daea9025ab499abbce3900f2e8920fd97c5c25708e9227ff52a68cf658bbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f87fa600-ed23-4c6b-b457-c937d526b554", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "683235728f35353aabd94dd6bacfaebc35fb775463896579a5649c33204f3fdf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience.

Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our\nconsumers. We exited 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our\n\u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\ncross-platform advertising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in\nthe logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition\nfrom new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize\n5\nthese industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional\ncompetition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on\na limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner\nthan we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\u2022\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets\nthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,\npublic transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.\nWe also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,\nGrab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\u2022\nDelivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,\nconsumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our\nDelivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\u2022\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,\nConvoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below.\nMobility\nOur  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerous\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both\nwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.", "start_char_idx": 22156, "end_char_idx": 26913, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f87fa600-ed23-4c6b-b457-c937d526b554": {"__data__": {"id_": "f87fa600-ed23-4c6b-b457-c937d526b554", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "924336aa-9bab-4669-ae24-25711834d803", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cead37c70f5681140693885b91ef0feb9b683ad27c9223c5685009f8e8c400a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fc01300-3761-4007-888e-00e8f5438256", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01aafa6a2c1bc179790d4d97c9c74c9290d5dae2bf85b28b620261a30c4ca55d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.

A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both\nwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model.\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\nCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly\nBill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which  went into  effect  in  January 2020, codified  a test  to determine  whether a worker  is an  employee  under  California  law.  The California\nAttorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are\nmisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nAlthough the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,\nthe parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state\nballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we\nexpect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply\nwith the provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A and \u201cNote 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n6\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:\n\u2022\nIn London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November\n2019, TfL  declined  to  issue us a license,  finding that we were not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including with respect  to  confidence  in our change  and release\nmanagement processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on\nlargely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\n\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational\nrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data\nsharing  requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharing\nservices.", "start_char_idx": 26240, "end_char_idx": 31162, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fc01300-3761-4007-888e-00e8f5438256": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fc01300-3761-4007-888e-00e8f5438256", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f87fa600-ed23-4c6b-b457-c937d526b554", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "683235728f35353aabd94dd6bacfaebc35fb775463896579a5649c33204f3fdf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0017069-f21a-41ae-80df-1e6506cdc6f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e0fb08fc793334defb65bc3964c7ba67374eef0ca211477f6a35831e1ea01b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license on\nlargely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\n\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational\nrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data\nsharing  requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharing\nservices. Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,\ncould have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate\nin Mexico City.\n\u2022\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times\nbefore riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\n\u2022\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap\non the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for\ntime and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by\nDrivers on our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on\nour platform  that went into effect  on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions  have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would\nimplement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative\nor regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.\nSee the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant\ncomplexities for our business and operating model.\nAs we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.\nData Privacy and Protection\nOur  technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  our\ncompliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.\nRegulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of\npersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two\nexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law\nwhich went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements\nfor  covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  of\npersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November\n2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.\nPayments and Financial Services\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.

In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws\ncould affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in\nseveral other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\nAntitrust\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as\n7\nthe  EU,  the  United  States,  Brazil,  and  India,  particularly  surrounding  issues  of  predatory  pricing,  price-fixing,  and  abuse  of  market  power.  In  addition,\ngovernmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant\nfines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on\nour contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.\nIntellectual Property\nWe  believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Our\nintellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,\nregistered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our\nability  to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.  We  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existing\nofferings  and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  our  offerings  through  research  and  development  (\u201cR&D\u201d)  and  acquisition  of  third-party  businesses  and\ntechnology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically\ngenerate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America and\nEurope. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as\nrecovery from the pandemic continues.\nDelivery\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the\nhistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related\nrestrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.\nHuman Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe  are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  in\napproximately 72 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world.", "start_char_idx": 34690, "end_char_idx": 39550, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d72909fd-3e00-4ebc-9c0d-21800950ae77": {"__data__": {"id_": "d72909fd-3e00-4ebc-9c0d-21800950ae77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0017069-f21a-41ae-80df-1e6506cdc6f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e0fb08fc793334defb65bc3964c7ba67374eef0ca211477f6a35831e1ea01b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e9d6830-68c0-4f6c-9bee-78db934dd5b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a749b07294ee6254994ca831b474a2212b2f58afd2f824f8e1ff30a43ae584d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We expect that seasonality will eventually return to its historic patterns as\nrecovery from the pandemic continues.\nDelivery\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the\nhistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.

Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People\nOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.\nAdapting  to a New Way of Working. In 2021, the ever-evolving  COVID-19 pandemic  continued to have a significant  impact on our employees and our\nworkforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able to\ndo so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans\u2014although\nmany of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new\ndynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress\nand social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young\nchildren. To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated\nthis crisis in their personal and professional lives. We provided\n8\nmore attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.\nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and\nare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys\nand related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in\n2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results of\nthese regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and\ngrowth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was created\nbased on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations\nthrough monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\nEmployee Development and Retention. We  believe  that employees  who have  opportunities  for  development  are  more engaged,  satisfied,  and productive.\nEmployees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber\nthrough internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable\nthem to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote\nwellness  and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life\u2019s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefits\npackages to our employees and their families.

We encourage\ndifferent opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work\nenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement\nprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,\nLGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership\nroles come from historically underrepresented groups.\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation\npackages of our most senior executives.\nWe encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or the\nIntegrity Helpline.\nAs a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do\nthat, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.\nIn July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.\nSome of our commitments to anti-racism include:\n\u2022\nRidding our platform of racism\n\u2022\nFighting racism with technology\n\u2022\nSustaining equity and belonging for all\n\u2022\nDriving equity in the community\nFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which are\navailable on our website.

However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an\napp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally\npatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is\neither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At\nUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative\nways to address these issues.\n\u2022\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work\nshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other\napp based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of\nour advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  on\npolicymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having access\nto protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\n\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide\nbenefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\n\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant to\nthis change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid\nholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even\nstronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n\u2022\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including\nimplementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\n\u2022\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  make\ninformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\u2022\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate\ndegree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,\nvarious  governments  around  the  world  have  implemented,  lifted,  and  in  some  regions  reinstated  travel  restrictions,  business  restrictions,  school  closures,\nlimitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for\nexample, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted and\nmany regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recover\nto pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been\nand may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic\nlevels. Additionally, the recent surge of COVID-19 primarily related to the rise of the Omicron variant in many markets in the United States and globally has\naffected and may continue to affect, among other things, travel and result in other COVID-19 related advisories and restrictions and may adversely affect both\nDriver supply and consumer demand for our Mobility offering. In addition, certain U.S. jurisdictions have issued emergency orders that require us to cap\n12\nfees charged to merchants on Delivery. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally for approximately\none year, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.", "start_char_idx": 58342, "end_char_idx": 63140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceb84601-4944-403a-9246-3767dd349e87": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceb84601-4944-403a-9246-3767dd349e87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "485d99bc-29f8-493b-902c-f38a8c2f2d60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cca8456740f68cab22d71d1e522d8ba862305515cd44564017dec8294028a345", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d15d7ffb-0cf6-4e2d-88c1-e293b0985dfc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb345028538d95e4cb4a888e70859ccdda57c0dd9cd5c0a0ea8151bb5bc7e251", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been\nand may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic\nlevels.

Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally for approximately\none year, and our shared rides offering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.\nFurthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we have since re-opened\ncertain offices and announced a hybrid return-to-office plan for employees, plans to return to the office may be negatively impacted by ongoing spread of the\nCOVID-19 virus, including positive tests for COVID-19 among some personnel who voluntarily returned to the office; these and any future instances of positive\nCOVID-19 tests of personnel working in our offices, as well as continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations,\nthe execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-party\nservice providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the\noutbreak and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability to\nwork remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working\nmay also result in privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from\nregulatory authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in\nresponse to future developments.\nWe have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety requirements on an expedited\nbasis, particularly those relating to delivery of food and other goods. Our understanding of applicable privacy, consumer protection and other legal and regulatory\nrequirements,  as  well  as  the  latest  guidance  from  regulatory  authorities  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  may  be  subject  to  legal  or  regulatory\nchallenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,\nor health and safety requirements in response to COVID-19 may heighten other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including our classification of\nDrivers. These challenges could result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has required\nand may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing models\nof our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do\nnot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,\nand results of operations. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\nduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the\nadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply\nchains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our\nend-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain  and cannot be predicted.  Moreover, even after shelter at home orders and travel advisories are lifted,\ndemand for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-\nCOVID-19 demand levels.", "start_char_idx": 62125, "end_char_idx": 67385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d15d7ffb-0cf6-4e2d-88c1-e293b0985dfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d15d7ffb-0cf6-4e2d-88c1-e293b0985dfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ceb84601-4944-403a-9246-3767dd349e87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9778ba05a01c2b843dc6892deb1698c78e315aae300562054cd88ba2cc43753c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c5bb340-7749-4ce9-aeb8-45cd86b0d900", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efdbab438eab60a4aea35d74e68dc712b4969babcf7bcc4f5043920b5a0e2ca8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the\nduration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, the\nadministration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supply\nchains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our\nend-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain  and cannot be predicted.  Moreover, even after shelter at home orders and travel advisories are lifted,\ndemand for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-\nCOVID-19 demand levels.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely\nimpacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital\nmarkets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could\nadversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or\n13\nexpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of\nthese Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we are\ninvolved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  such\nproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are\nmisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.", "start_char_idx": 66415, "end_char_idx": 71391, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c5bb340-7749-4ce9-aeb8-45cd86b0d900": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c5bb340-7749-4ce9-aeb8-45cd86b0d900", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d15d7ffb-0cf6-4e2d-88c1-e293b0985dfc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb345028538d95e4cb4a888e70859ccdda57c0dd9cd5c0a0ea8151bb5bc7e251", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06ae5165-9ae2-44c2-ae0b-84b8ca369a2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c9a5dc5f522936fe7f4112472dc7c9bc85988912658591d25cb420b8a315411", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions.

Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are\nmisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. In\nAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during\nthe pendency  of the  lawsuit, and  while the  California  Court of Appeal subsequently  affirmed  the  lower court\u2019s ruling,  on April  12, 2021, the parties  filed a\nstipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have\nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority\nof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAnother  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward.

Further, some of our current or potential competitors\nhave, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographic\nmarket. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating\nhistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond\nmore quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may\nrender our products or offerings less attractive.

In certain geographic markets and\nregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts\nand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and\npromotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been\nmodified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing\nmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers.

If our service quality diminishes or our competitors\u2019 products achieve greater market\nadoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation\nof our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers\nand merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,\nincluding as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of\ndisease or similar public health concern, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not\nfundamentally changed, dissatisfaction  with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In\naddition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable\nmanner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish or\nmaintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality\nsupport, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and our\nbusiness would suffer.\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their\nservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or\nservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other\naspects of our business.

We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\nbreaches,  including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  and\nmerchants,  which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past\nresulted in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests\nmay result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our\nnetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.\n17\nAny decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our\nfuture operating results.\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to\nour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,\nprosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make\ndeliveries through Delivery, our qualification  and background check standards are generally  less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to\nprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an\nefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification,  screening, and background check process (including any\nchanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired  companies)  could also reduce  the number of Drivers in those  markets  or extend  the time\nrequired to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check\nprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers\nundergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\nMaintaining  and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.

Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,\nincreased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nIn 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have\noccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto  result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial  results and future prospects. As our platform  continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur  brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality of\nservice, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and\nour reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,\nour business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood  reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia  strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and potential  competitors  will  expand  their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our\nbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and\nreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\n18\nOur  historical  workplace  culture  and  forward-leaning  approach  created  operational,  compliance,  and  cultural  challenges,  and  a  failure  to  address  these\nchallenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in\nthe  future  continue  to  harm,  our  business  results  and  financial  condition.

If\nother criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be\nharmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther,  we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,\nconsumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we\nmay face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In\naddition, the growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road\nusers and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or\nuneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan\nareas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours,\nall of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we\nare exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant\ncosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol.

In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and\ntypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain\ncities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our\nrevenue  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonal\nfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of\nDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult\nto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing\nseasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may\nfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to\nexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace\nwith technological  changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental  or other regulations affecting  our business, harm to our brand or\nreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nour ability to:\n\u2022\ngrow supply and demand on our platform;\n\u2022\nincrease existing platform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\n\u2022\ncontinue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n\u2022\nprovide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\n\u2022\nexpand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n\u2022\ncompete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n\u2022\nidentify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n\u2022\npenetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n\u2022\nreduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public\ntransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n\u2022\nmaintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n\u2022\nenter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,\nJapan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022\nincrease positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier\ndemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve profitability.\n23\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan  areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are\nsusceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in\nwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics\nor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,\nor regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater\ndegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect\nour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business.", "start_char_idx": 132380, "end_char_idx": 137466, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15c0c0b4-3b06-4a79-9140-86a91d4ba100": {"__data__": {"id_": "15c0c0b4-3b06-4a79-9140-86a91d4ba100", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f29cddb5-bd4e-49f4-9555-f876e911f51b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2942445112d918565c8b64549fa1ead0afadc0e6cfc071000e2a67543e5cf63e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79e53bfa-9eb8-409b-afb8-d42fa08d3f1e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e5f3dad1dbc2ab7bdc15858d90582c59f17b102abe7fed1f31dade3391ae5e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Outbreaks of contagious\ndiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in\nwhich we operate.

In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect\nour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew\nexisting licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap on\nthe number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City implemented a per-mile and per-minute\nminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by\nDrivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial\nperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing\ntrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have\npassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing\nservices on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is\nsmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating\nsuburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total\naddressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and\nfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related\nMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  by\nmandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  banned\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the\nrequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against\nus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our\noperations.  In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become  inconvenient  because  of airport  rules or regulations,  or more expensive  because  of airport-\nimposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

While we\nhave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport\nboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar\nagreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing\n24\nnetwork. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous\nvehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has\nacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that\nthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercialized\nridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer\nautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomous\nvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties\nwith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which\nwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing\nridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to\nconsumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects\nwould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\nand operating results.\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing.

Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamic\nnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability to\nattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remote\nwork, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance\nand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  or\nadditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our business\ndifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,\noperations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition\ninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel\ntransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and\nyears of industry experience.

Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-cost\nalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use\none of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public\ntransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity\nand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the\nmerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases\nfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at\nmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products\nand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.\nSimilarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  may\nincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are\nbeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to\nseek alternative sources of income.

We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a data\nsecurity incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an\nemployee had unintentionally posted publicly on a\n26\ncode-sharing  website  used  by  software  developers  (the  \u201c2014  Breach\u201d).  In  October  and  November  of  2016,  outside  actors  downloaded  the  personal  data  of\napproximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers,\nand drivers\u2019 license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We\ncurrently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. and\nforeign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d and \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and\nother processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and\ndata  protection  practices,\u201d  below.  As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.

For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such\nnew or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product\nchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driver\ndissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global\n27\nGross  Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  our\ntechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for\nridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant\nfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of\ncash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or\nfatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while\nusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could\nadversely impact our business.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the\ncash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not\nalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we\ncannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to\na variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems\nfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such\ncollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,\nimpact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\nlimit our business model.

Our business is dependent\nupon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the\nfuture contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released.

Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration\nof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party\nsuppliers, and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nWe  have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted.

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is\ndependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related\n29\ninterpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the availability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging\ninfrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers.

We may be\nsubject  to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  source\nlicensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source\nsoftware to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed\nto monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open\nsource license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable\nterms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of\nopen-source  software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legal\ninterpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly\nrelease certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source\nprojects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we\n31\nwould be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code.

Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may\nlimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $238 million of\nCareem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of December 31, 2021. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our\nexisting and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need\nto incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will\nreduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for\nworking capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our\nvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and\nthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise.

For example, we\nmay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other\nmultinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.\nCurrently,  certain  jurisdictions  are  investigating  our  compliance  with  tax  rules.  If  it  is  determined  that  we  are  not  compliant  with  such  rules,  we  could  owe\nadditional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed\nto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters\nare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject\nto such taxes; even when such payments\n32\nare made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting\nthe payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and\ncurrently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial\nposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by\nour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from\nthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our\ntax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,\nwhich could impact  our financial  position.  In addition,  in connection  with any planned or future  acquisitions,  we may acquire  businesses that have differing\nlicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our\nlicenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain\njurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial\nstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S.", "start_char_idx": 195673, "end_char_idx": 201046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "752ddbfe-1114-46b4-8bfb-1cd033781d9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "752ddbfe-1114-46b4-8bfb-1cd033781d9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "60114073-d393-4cb6-9c29-f42886677e80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f51e41a050e85a27884fb2f1dada459ad172b90eb04d706f7b96be71ee734e6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca7228b3-bf48-4bf7-9483-76c190e5fcbf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "50e8d52a803d986fa197ef55aa25ffa311f7aa4cde72ecb7993f1a458d1bb362", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition,  in connection  with any planned or future  acquisitions,  we may acquire  businesses that have differing\nlicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our\nlicenses and arrangements.

U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in\n2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remain\nunclear  in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementing\nregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In\naddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable\nincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability\nthat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates\nwhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and\n$12.4 billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity\nmay not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses\nwe acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,\nDrizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense.

In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays.

Any\ninability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,\nrevenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  other\nauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, Mexico\nCity\u2019s  Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  a\nprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  a\nrequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,\nwe have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our\nfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion.", "start_char_idx": 212359, "end_char_idx": 217072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7909adbb-6e8f-4057-acb8-09c9af804b24": {"__data__": {"id_": "7909adbb-6e8f-4057-acb8-09c9af804b24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b629a09-8183-4963-9fef-6b7ba46fa3d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c93bcb4ba060f7f046ed68ab9c306c2a37188d9beb3ab36fe38da469607597a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9757b36-858a-4e16-ae95-3b496b51a5be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44d047ab861639191dfb08d843c0e640c40c2753e44e0fc70400b0853a2adb07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

In\nAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising\ncap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.\nAlthough such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in\nNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect\non January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In\naddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January\n1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to\nnegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in\ncountries outside the United States. If other\n35\njurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who\nused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain  changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\nas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.", "start_char_idx": 216219, "end_char_idx": 221091, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9757b36-858a-4e16-ae95-3b496b51a5be": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9757b36-858a-4e16-ae95-3b496b51a5be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7909adbb-6e8f-4057-acb8-09c9af804b24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0f40f082b3f55afb8429542c495348a73f407fd5743e2b438564af983bb918a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "69a55670-0b88-41cb-a2e0-033ac9040e17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "618193280b5ddca37052f2dc3d114c2738113b7ad65cbea8aedb2e4d9433c833", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities.

In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that\nhave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle\ncertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to\ncomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  and\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\nmodel. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how\nwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions  on our business, especially  our ridesharing\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us\nto share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide.", "start_char_idx": 220240, "end_char_idx": 225242, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69a55670-0b88-41cb-a2e0-033ac9040e17": {"__data__": {"id_": "69a55670-0b88-41cb-a2e0-033ac9040e17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9757b36-858a-4e16-ae95-3b496b51a5be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "44d047ab861639191dfb08d843c0e640c40c2753e44e0fc70400b0853a2adb07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30c0b578-0fb8-4a86-9b5e-6978f3100bba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "beebf70af556554ea62b9fed5a09a5bc5311e5780f7a3db57933d434558d2965", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025.

The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme\nCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions\nof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims\nof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are\ntoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both.

In  addition,  Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses.

These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing  SCA, many payment transactions  on our platform  may fail to be authenticated  due to platform  users not\ncompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  services\nreceived by those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from\nconsumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith  changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  payments\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the\nEuropean payments regulations.\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money\ntransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\nrestrictions.  Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,\nor other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on\nour ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\nand payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering\nand  sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.", "start_char_idx": 232256, "end_char_idx": 237111, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e49ac3b3-8228-4aa6-9bb8-188b7b62c4c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e49ac3b3-8228-4aa6-9bb8-188b7b62c4c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d520b25-7ab7-4283-9f13-3c9ab3479dea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cafaa60f94e78b0eec0e211df2b63104f60bd32e13262905e40cb147a538b86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "79ed66e1-4adf-4499-8156-fb59cd0d985d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a19dba1902232390ce9d745b6afb22696b87ccde9630cff58e23d166bdaf565e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,\nor other enforcement actions.

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our business\npractices, such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved the\nbreach of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,\nsettle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the\nAttorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to\nour failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and\nthe 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December\n2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and may\ncontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material\nfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a\nproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety\nReport. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15\n38\nmillion ($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions\nfrom such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other\ncountries.\nThese  government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  senior\nmanagement. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to\nchange our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional\nreputational  harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conduct\ninvestigations.

Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\nlegislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.\nThese and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws. Such\nviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory\nentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,\nfuture failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately\n$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with the\nOffice of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulated\njudgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million\nand assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,\nenforcement  actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches\nexperienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory\nauthorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January\n14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach\nthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential\nclaims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis  risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened  individual  data rights, data breach  requirements,  limitations  on data retention,  strengthened  requirements  for special  categories  of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates  have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazil\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)\n39\npassed in California in November 2020.\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal\ndata outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the\nadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.\nIf we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer\npersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement\nfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in\nthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand.

Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation\nsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions.

The results of any such\nlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\nconsuming,  costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legal\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition,  we regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our terms  of service  with  end-users.

For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct\nclaims by platform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n40\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\nadditional  compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  of\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\nresponsible.  Additional  compliance  requirements  may compel  us to revise  or expand our compliance  program,  including  the procedures  we use to verify  the\nidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our\nplatform.\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense.", "start_char_idx": 252327, "end_char_idx": 257585, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69eae376-370e-4455-a9fb-df41f8873596": {"__data__": {"id_": "69eae376-370e-4455-a9fb-df41f8873596", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3c8660b-8000-4cf7-9f74-c5cacf9ef8e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fb01bd5fa0614d87284b95f81be3c87b4600bbfb155c07a17165642141468b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "206c90ed-1ae6-4a40-ad48-7ce3ae4bd411", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbf2add8df481842afefed23189517d601f74db28e23f22d4316584f0ccb5096", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations.

If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers  may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In\nconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to\ndefend,  and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negative\npublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these\npractices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other\naspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to\nour Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\nadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that\n41\ntransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts\nthat may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,\nhistorical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our\nreserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a\nsignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively  using our platform  or when an individual impersonates  a Driver.", "start_char_idx": 256766, "end_char_idx": 262070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "206c90ed-1ae6-4a40-ad48-7ce3ae4bd411": {"__data__": {"id_": "206c90ed-1ae6-4a40-ad48-7ce3ae4bd411", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69eae376-370e-4455-a9fb-df41f8873596", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d1426d545f51fd8fcefd187013bae6ad210823aef5ed1b5510285a34e33ca8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f7454a4-6a73-4d5f-9f64-8a5309666639", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e2086e3a824a44959c057fe8ba9111980b773fc9290a9524be0c10b4c8c0ee5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.

As we expand to include more\nofferings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general\nliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are\nclaimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do\nnot result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay\notherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be\nsubject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by\ngovernmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\nAdditional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service\nproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with\nus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative\npublicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\nsubject  of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a\nresult, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of\nothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware\ndesigns,  registered  and  unregistered  trademarks,  trademark  applications,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable),  patents,  and  patent\napplications.", "start_char_idx": 261120, "end_char_idx": 266332, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f7454a4-6a73-4d5f-9f64-8a5309666639": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f7454a4-6a73-4d5f-9f64-8a5309666639", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "206c90ed-1ae6-4a40-ad48-7ce3ae4bd411", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbf2add8df481842afefed23189517d601f74db28e23f22d4316584f0ccb5096", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a897cd2-074f-48d4-9990-7caea50ad004", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bbc6fec1a84cae9adc462334efa8ac7b7f90dfaf8a6f820bca5f9ab9ee50186", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, an increasing number of\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering.

Changes  to  our  business  model  and  accounting  methods  could  result  in  changes  to  our  financial\nstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in\nmaterially  different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reporting\ncontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct\ntheir business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under\nthe Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute\ninvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe that\nwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims\nrelated to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United\nStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidly\nchanged market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,\nfinancial  position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019\ndeclarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures\nhave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.\nFurthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be\nimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\nWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believe\nwe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through\npreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic has\nreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by\nlaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\nTo comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering in\nmost markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, to\nwork remotely.\nAs vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and\nconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driver\nincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.\nWhile we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,\nresults of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any future\nwaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional\nactions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the further impact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other\nfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors.", "start_char_idx": 297571, "end_char_idx": 302752, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c603397-2770-4f3b-a1d3-b9f562089903": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c603397-2770-4f3b-a1d3-b9f562089903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a09f5815-bbcd-4e6d-ad0f-7811f065ef0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0199f93670251b79d530c54d4f32ec851555ca5693b0dead180d832fca8b7a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7750c53b-cf37-4099-96ce-69a869f30115", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03f694e087a8b96608eca17f72e02e4182d9a2f943b4d7cb0c44d04b2574555e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged\ncompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that\nProposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the\nProtect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us\nasserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent\n49\ncontractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app\nwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority\ndecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.", "start_char_idx": 302088, "end_char_idx": 306681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7750c53b-cf37-4099-96ce-69a869f30115": {"__data__": {"id_": "7750c53b-cf37-4099-96ce-69a869f30115", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c603397-2770-4f3b-a1d3-b9f562089903", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8b20f0cc03876da74868796f8e5a089a5da444f5df6453f57ce8ec9406ce128", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7187c79-2b40-476f-bdf7-f35120b1d6b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6237ec345eda4f595f83bea463ca25e212ff30fd0a60b6270767fbb793a25647", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers.

Compensation hearings will\ntake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.\nIn September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we\nwould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (including\nminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potential\npenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\nand  we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.  Any  of  these  events  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  result  of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\ncondition  and  cash  flows,  see  the  risk  factor  titled  \u201c-Our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if  Drivers  were  classified  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-\nemployees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part\nII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn  addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  and  the  section  titled  \u201cCritical  Accounting\nEstimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "start_char_idx": 305723, "end_char_idx": 309992, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7187c79-2b40-476f-bdf7-f35120b1d6b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7187c79-2b40-476f-bdf7-f35120b1d6b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7750c53b-cf37-4099-96ce-69a869f30115", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03f694e087a8b96608eca17f72e02e4182d9a2f943b4d7cb0c44d04b2574555e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "417c5252-2aca-4395-a2e1-c0d60c46b431", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4803a2ea5065febec0cda00d185be7623377ba9485e43a338e0be20aa0c6cf55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In  addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  and  the  section  titled  \u201cCritical  Accounting\nEstimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n50\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nYear Ended December 31,\nConstant Currency \n(In millions, except percentages)\n2020\n2021\n2020 to 2021 %\nChange\n2020 to 2021 % Change\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (\u201cMAPCs\u201d) \n93\n118\n27 %\nTrips \n5,025\n6,368\n27 %\nGross Bookings \n$\n57,897 \n$\n90,415 \n56 %\n53 %\nRevenue\n$\n11,139 \n$\n17,455 \n57 %\n54 %\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. \n$\n(6,768)\n$\n(496)\n93 %\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n1,169 \n$\n1,596 \n37 %\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n(873)\n$\n(348)\n60 %\nAdjusted EBITDA \n$\n(2,528)\n$\n(774)\n69 %\n See the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\n See the section titled \u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.\nMAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. includes stock-based compensation expense of $827 million and $1.2 billion during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nHighlights for 2021\nOverall Gross Bookings increased by $32.5 billion in 2021, up 56%, or 53% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2020. Delivery Gross Bookings grew\n66% from 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related to\nCOVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase\nin certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for\nservices provided. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 36%, on a constant currency basis, from 2020, due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the\nimpacts of COVID-19.\nRevenue was $17.5 billion, or up 57% year-over-year, reflecting the overall growth in our Delivery business and an increase in Freight revenue attributable to\nthe acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in\nvolumes with our top shippers.\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $496 million, a 93% improvement year-over-year, driven by a $1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of our\nATG Business to Aurora, a $1.6 billion pre-tax net benefit relating to Uber\u2019s equity investments, as well as reductions in our fixed cost structure and increased\nvariable cost efficiencies. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also included $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was $774 million, improving $1.8 billion from 2020 with Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit of $1.6 billion.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs\nrelated to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuring\nand related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for\nseverance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.\nThese activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020\nplanned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair our\nability to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourth\nquarter 2020 planned cost structure.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driver\nincentives, as Mobility Driver additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.\nMobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable  to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by variable costs attributable  to the\noverall growth of the business.\nDelivery Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjusted\nEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.\nDelivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in\nfood  delivery  orders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  combined  with  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  and\ninternational markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with an\noverall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments\nand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nDelivery adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily  attributable  to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially  offset by a $2.6 billion increase  in cost of\nrevenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.\nFreight Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjusted\nEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.", "start_char_idx": 337738, "end_char_idx": 342135, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf061f9a-0f4e-400b-9b6d-ca5cbf23d8d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf061f9a-0f4e-400b-9b6d-ca5cbf23d8d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56ebafb0-0b42-460f-ae93-9ed00e8b3c3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4be92d1e2507661551b6ea29485b95da67117af0a6c87b3c7445b7ba9f82ffad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cb2f374-fd27-434d-a661-10925a413725", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36279132164f6f4ff0782a8546610f9dfd71e4e6e5801bfc0b44b9d1830ff733", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments\nand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\nDelivery adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily  attributable  to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially  offset by a $2.6 billion increase  in cost of\nrevenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.\nFreight Segment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjusted\nEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.\nFreight revenue increased primarily attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021.

For more information about how we use these non-\nGAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, see the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\nplatform  in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  of\ntransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  an\nUberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that\nTrips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n60\nGross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility and New Mobility rides;\nDelivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives; and Freight revenue.\nGross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.\n(In millions)\n Q1 2020\nQ2 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ4 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ2 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ4 2021\nMobility\n$\n10,874 \n$\n3,046 \n$\n5,905 \n$\n6,789 \n$\n6,773 $\n8,640 $\n9,883 $\n11,340 \nDelivery\n4,683 \n6,961 \n8,550 \n10,050 \n12,461 \n12,912 \n12,828 \n13,444 \nFreight\n198 \n212 \n290 \n313 \n302 \n348 \n402 \n1,082 \nAll Other\n21 \n5 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \nTake Rate is defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.\nAdjusted EBITDA.", "start_char_idx": 341391, "end_char_idx": 345378, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cb2f374-fd27-434d-a661-10925a413725": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cb2f374-fd27-434d-a661-10925a413725", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf061f9a-0f4e-400b-9b6d-ca5cbf23d8d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "993b63d1f52edf9af8b962314647123fdd9d917d62feddc0e7b8c56d101f5bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d5d22ff-1128-4a39-bbc8-b4ddabecf364", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "575bda5f8711dd15ff66cd1e1addd716d78af9d1679e1e806c281ea3cb57e82a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(In millions)\n Q1 2020\nQ2 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ4 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ2 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ4 2021\nMobility\n$\n10,874 \n$\n3,046 \n$\n5,905 \n$\n6,789 \n$\n6,773 $\n8,640 $\n9,883 $\n11,340 \nDelivery\n4,683 \n6,961 \n8,550 \n10,050 \n12,461 \n12,912 \n12,828 \n13,444 \nFreight\n198 \n212 \n290 \n313 \n302 \n348 \n402 \n1,082 \nAll Other\n21 \n5 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \nTake Rate is defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.\nAdjusted EBITDA.

In addition to revenue, net income\n(loss),  income  (loss)  from  operations,  and  other  results  under  GAAP,  we  use  Adjusted  EBITDA  and  revenue  growth  rates  in  constant  currency,  which  are\ndescribed below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to\nevaluate  our  operating  performance.

Our  calculation  of  these  non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset\n61\nimpairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not\nindicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted\nby COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment,\nthe costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses.

Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team\nand board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash\nexpenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding\nthe  impacts  of  COVID-19  response  initiatives  related  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Drivers  personally  impacted  by  COVID-19,  the  cost  of  personal\nprotective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and\nfood deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting\nestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have\nbeen  used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the\ninherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n64\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated  financial  statements.  For  additional  information,  see  the  disclosure  included  in  Note  1  \u2013  Description  of  Business  and  Summary  of  Significant\nAccounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and\nDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with\nend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we\nhave no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user\nand are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We\nhave concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery\ntransactions.  The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  and\nincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting\nagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,\nuncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\nDriver Incentives\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to\ncustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service\nreceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform.

Judgment is required to determine the appropriate\nclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions\nwhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,\nand trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult,  actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our amortization  expense,  as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of\nconversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the\nunderlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our\nconsolidated  balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income\n(expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public\nOffering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible\n65\nnotes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO\ndates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,\nwhich was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during each\nperiod to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.\nUpon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires\njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated\nfair  value  of  our investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as equity  financing\ntransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar\nto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity\nsecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an\nequity  investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  our\nconsolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its\namortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the\ndifference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down\nof the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality\nof the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare\nthe present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-\nrelated impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance\nsheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding\nreduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,\nbut not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 net\nincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences.", "start_char_idx": 369078, "end_char_idx": 374347, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d056b26-ed34-4b7f-82a5-4b8896f80c4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d056b26-ed34-4b7f-82a5-4b8896f80c4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7327c536-9a8e-4a90-9dfd-c627ee134148", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfe7240a7ebcd3b389b17db0425e8f620bb9192fb56f1c1c8d2daf2144f39e59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf4c1ab4-1d09-4bf0-91e3-d1a896f9d03d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94c9e842ce4c42ccc55f89a30a751eb04657b3e487ca8dede3972f70e29c11e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss), net of tax.

Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 net\nincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter in\narrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in\nearnings.\nWe  review  our equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of the\ninvestment  may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  and\noperating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the\ninvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined\nand an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for\ninvestments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and\n66\nassumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment\ncharges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe  review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  (in  the  fourth  quarter)  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  goodwill  might  be\nimpaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying\nvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review\nfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,\nbusiness, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting\nthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test\nis then performed.\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,\nrisk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when\nwe believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change\nbased on new information and future events.\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.", "start_char_idx": 373472, "end_char_idx": 378736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf4c1ab4-1d09-4bf0-91e3-d1a896f9d03d": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf4c1ab4-1d09-4bf0-91e3-d1a896f9d03d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d056b26-ed34-4b7f-82a5-4b8896f80c4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8b4f801efb8be47abcfbb62d48168e6f22e3976a3cdf80d41f0b7d261b13691", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d187d6b-2820-41b1-8589-d53bc392b69d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9cb29ba560936ff05a1d6b466f449355edf002a77c2849f87acfb4c07dc323a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.

These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change\nbased on new information and future events.\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting\nperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe  are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  The\nestablishment  of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  to\ndetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the\nextent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the\neffective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,\nwe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly\nassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\n67\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019\ncompensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\nloss  experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss costs,  which\nconsider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.", "start_char_idx": 377741, "end_char_idx": 382728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d187d6b-2820-41b1-8589-d53bc392b69d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d187d6b-2820-41b1-8589-d53bc392b69d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf4c1ab4-1d09-4bf0-91e3-d1a896f9d03d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94c9e842ce4c42ccc55f89a30a751eb04657b3e487ca8dede3972f70e29c11e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d7df5be-af16-4e1d-9af1-d11a981f36d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e072ab99c9084c540d0af3325891cb3a6afa0d2e5d863b5f073bd8fc5205c7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date.

These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new\ninformation becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near\nterm from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of\nour board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding\nRSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains\nservice-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the\nmajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial\nand operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting\nstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account\nfor forfeitures when they occur.\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-\nScholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest\nrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n\u2022\nExpected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\n\u2022\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n\u2022\nExpected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of\nour own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than\nthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\n\u2022\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe continue  to use judgment  in evaluating  the expected  volatility  and expected  term  utilized  in our stock-based  compensation  expense calculation  on a\nprospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected\nterm, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n68\nITEM 7A.", "start_char_idx": 381998, "end_char_idx": 387166, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d7df5be-af16-4e1d-9af1-d11a981f36d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d7df5be-af16-4e1d-9af1-d11a981f36d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d187d6b-2820-41b1-8589-d53bc392b69d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9cb29ba560936ff05a1d6b466f449355edf002a77c2849f87acfb4c07dc323a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c01250f-304e-4d5b-b9b8-f18f0e0baf64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4646330eb7ae866d62f41b366a4e3125288deb7565d23f52175e13873d1f895", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than\nthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\n\u2022\nExpected dividend yield.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point\nincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million\nas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur  investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market\nfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to\nvalue given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.\nThese investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in\nthe fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set\nperiod of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial  reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)\n(PCAOB)  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and Tupelo\nParent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company in\npurchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly and\nTransplace are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over\nfinancial reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2021.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\n71\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "start_char_idx": 393955, "end_char_idx": 399035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed162d12-5f4a-40a5-ad07-1d683ce099a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed162d12-5f4a-40a5-ad07-1d683ce099a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7347d4e-9800-49cb-bd29-a4789b3999cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ebc2f4d7f9a606c6723d473af2569f3b5b5ff966134216ed910a710e04aef7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a91a936d-6281-47fd-a3e0-8bd0da1130f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "742686c0c671e9050093310d135b01521cd634586eaf35855425eee5a6eb6975", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-Users\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of the\nCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to\nend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or\nagent  in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  the\npresentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year\nended  December  31, 2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3 billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,\nrefunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including\nincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the\npresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,\nwhich  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whether\ntransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the\npresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip\ntransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver\nstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and\nincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents\nthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount\nfor losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods\napplied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development\npatterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  by\nmanagement  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.

STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is\na technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and other  consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d).

Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the\nreported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which\nmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of\ninvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting\ncertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certain\ninvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global\nfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations\nand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to\ncredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or\ncommercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit\nquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds\nwithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a\nlimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service\nproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the\nyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe  have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Our  operations  have\nhistorically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving\ncredit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,\nadditional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to\nobtain additional\n82\nfinancing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared  the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.

COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic\nconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel\nrestrictions, and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business and  operations by  reducing, in  particular,  the  global  demand  for\nMobility offerings,  while  accelerating  the growth of our Delivery offerings.  In light  of the evolving nature  of COVID-19 and the uncertainty  it continues to\nproduce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of\noperations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on\nfuture developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further\nresurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial\nmarkets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S.\ngovernment and agency securities, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, which\nare included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies and\nalso include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are\nclassified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents\nand restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2019\n2020\n2021\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n10,873 \n$\n5,647 \n$\n4,295 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current\n99 \n250 \n631 \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current\n1,095 \n1,494 \n2,879 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\n$\n12,067 \n$\n7,391 \n$\n7,805 \nCollateral Held by Insurer\nCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies (\u201cJames River\u201d).

As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under the\nindemnification agreements for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is\npresented as collateral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as\ncollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held.

Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance\nrisks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the\namount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk\ntransfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for\nongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021,\nand adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated\nstatement of operations consisting of the difference between\n83\nthe Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on\nthe Transferred Claims.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is credit card and includes (a)\nend-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us, or (ii)\ncompleted shipments where we invoice Freight customers (\u201cShippers\u201d) and payment has not been received. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these\nparties varies by region and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.\nRefer to Note 10 \u2013 Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.\nAlthough  we pre-authorize  forms  of  payment  to  mitigate  our exposure,  we  bear  the  cost  of any  accounts  receivable  losses.  We  record  an  allowance  for\ndoubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.\nWe consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as cost\nof revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographical\ntrends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\nLeased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for sale\nas of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd.

We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our\nprior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease\ncomponents, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for\nall leases that qualify.\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\nbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an\nasset  which we do not own. Right of use  (\u201cROU\u201d) assets  represent  our right  to use  an  underlying  asset  for  the lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

The\npurchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the\nacquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year\nfrom the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion\nof the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units\nexpected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign\ngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\nloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable equity securities in\npublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments\nin non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether\nnon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.\nNon-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for\nimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,\nbut would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a\nsignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,\nor  a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  an\nimpairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\ninvestment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Securities\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the\ntransaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities\ninclude commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-\nfor-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair\nvalue recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond\none year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.

We\nadopted  ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debt\nsecurities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances\nwhere we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and\namortized  cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.  In\ncircumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a\ncredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit\nratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash\nflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the\ndifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment\nto net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in\nexpected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling\nfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted for\nunder the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the\ninvestment balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of\nequity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. We\nevaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the\n86\nconsolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but\nwould not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings\ncapacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial\nresults and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the\nvalue of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the\nimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value.", "start_char_idx": 447746, "end_char_idx": 452769, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b0c41a2-6ab8-40ea-aacb-c3a0c44cb8cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b0c41a2-6ab8-40ea-aacb-c3a0c44cb8cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c2ace27-8312-41a6-a722-42d2251ed8f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3c28b35fecb69f1e920300291d8674d0af7058eb76c8a9ec472bc702ba117a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b5b4959-1753-4836-91af-2b018991b49e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d35f38ee7e795968934cb911c5929ab805e3093e005b2a4a0ad1d5a6ac511126", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate.

In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    \nLevel 1    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nOur  primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accrued\nliabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 \u2013\nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,\ninvolve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an\nentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated\nfinancial  statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has the  power  to  make  decisions  that  most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of\nwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests\nin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-\ndemand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and\nfulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also\ngenerate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from\ncustomers' use of Freight services.\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\n87\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge\nDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.\nThe acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction.

In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to\nDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is\ncomplete.  We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts\nshall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,\nwhich represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users\nof $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year ended\nDecember  31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billion\nassociated with these delivery transactions.\nIn all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, this\nclass of end-users are not our customers.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation\nof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other\nparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and\nMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\nFor the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or\nDelivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase\nor otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to\nperform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-\nusers. As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible\nfor Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility\nand Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not\nresult in us controlling the services provided to end-users.", "start_char_idx": 456032, "end_char_idx": 460897, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d34b15c-f496-493b-a1aa-ea3a80817ac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d34b15c-f496-493b-a1aa-ea3a80817ac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b5b4959-1753-4836-91af-2b018991b49e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d35f38ee7e795968934cb911c5929ab805e3093e005b2a4a0ad1d5a6ac511126", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a130d45-7a9a-4d87-a114-a1c1a580086a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5dc3b08cc933d352347c0b76f1d8f176108ae1b90c7314b3bd038ad7e42be36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions.

While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility\nand Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not\nresult in us controlling the services provided to end-users.\nIn the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery\nservices with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully\ncompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the\nservice to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide\ndelivery  services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarily\nresponsible for the services.\nMobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully\ncomplete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount\npaid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by\nDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services\nprovided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time\nfollowing the completion of a trip.\n88\nIn addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect our\nservice fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As we\ncurrently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we\nconcluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements until collected from Drivers.\nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.\nDelivery\nWe  derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of the  platform  and related  service  to  successfully\ncomplete a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well\nas select other goods. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the difference\nbetween the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we\npay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. We\ntypically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.\nFreight\nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.

In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  we\nrecognize revenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin to\ndestination by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not\nmaterial. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper where\nwe are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to the\nShipper. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier\nthat meets the Shipper's specifications. We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.\nAccordingly, we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the related\nrevenue on a net basis. Contracts where we do not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2019,\n2020 and 2021.\n89\nAll Other Revenue\nE-Bikes and E-Scooters\nPrior to the second quarter of 2020, All Other revenue (formerly our Other Bets segment) consisted primarily of revenue from New Mobility products, which\nwere derived from operating leases as defined within ASC 842.

After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.\nRefer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.\nAdvanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Revenue\nIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under this\ncollaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and\npresentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.\nIncentives to Customers\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair\nvalue  of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variable\nconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since\nincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We\nexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under\nASC  340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amount\nrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established\nusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.\nIn  some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resulting\nshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nAdvertising Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.\nAdvertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the\namount billed to merchants as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts\nand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,\nor generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal\ndeliveries during a limited time period.

These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring\nend-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and\nmarketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to\nend-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market.

Refunds to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction\nwith the Platform are recorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with the corresponding transaction.\nOther\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue\nproducing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included\nas a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nPractical Expedients\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts\nwith an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe  account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of  GAAP,  which  requires\ncompensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they\noccur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,\nusing appropriate valuation techniques.\nService-Based Awards\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period, which is generally four years.\nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,\ntypically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest\nrates.

Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulative\none-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-\nbased awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 11 \u2013 Stockholders' Equity for further information on our IPO.\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-\nbased awards.\n91\nMarket-Based Awards\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based service conditions, performance-\nbased conditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The performance-based\nconditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-\nbased awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including\nexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage.

We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.

Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\nWe  recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based\non the weighting of positive and negative evidence.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external\ncomparable  data  and  are  inherently  uncertain.  Unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may  occur  that  could  affect  either  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\nExpenses\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\n\u2022\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,\ncredit  card  processing  fees,  bank  fees,  data  center  and  networking  expenses,  mobile  device  and  service  costs,  costs  incurred  for  certain  Delivery\ntransactions where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freight\ntransportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\n\u2022\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of\ncustomer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\n\u2022\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the\nallocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion,\n$1.0 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and\n2021, respectively.\n\u2022\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design\nand product development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in\nJanuary 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain\ncorporate costs.\n\u2022\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well\nas allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal\nsettlements.\n\u2022\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.", "start_char_idx": 484250, "end_char_idx": 489420, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "969c4dcc-e568-4ea7-bce5-8a2b905dcdeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "969c4dcc-e568-4ea7-bce5-8a2b905dcdeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4394e9bf-7e52-4581-b031-fb11b589b353", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "83a9ac676b6544b20198a8bac308fc2cc9ea3b6396e1220de07343f8be81f8c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c59031e-a510-4aea-afce-0407b192e6c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5693b6b576c4b4bf6dc89ede448981af020852d5461763fdb0a91dc192c0309", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in\nJanuary 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain\ncorporate costs.\n\u2022\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well\nas allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs.

We record a liability for employee termination\nbenefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has\ncommunicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action,\ncommits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected\ncompletion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits\nthey will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be\nmade or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the\ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized\nat the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\nguidance.\n93\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our\nclassification  policy  for  each  category  of  operating  expense.  Personnel  costs  are  classified  based  on  each  employee\u2019s  classification,  lease  costs  (including\nimpairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease\u2019s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived\nassets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries\u2019 activities. Monetary assets\nand liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in\neffect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are\nrecorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities\nwith non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and\nrevenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  during  the  year.  Cumulative  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  other\ncomprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to\ncommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if\nall income for the period had been distributed.\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.", "start_char_idx": 488416, "end_char_idx": 493692, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c59031e-a510-4aea-afce-0407b192e6c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c59031e-a510-4aea-afce-0407b192e6c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aee9a7ed-0269-468c-aba8-ee59fe08ead2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c6c6d903a3d8e42647992ba251a0de0aa821369f5e800c8791c1277b63f54c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "969c4dcc-e568-4ea7-bce5-8a2b905dcdeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ce3686441d90f88bd773bbc778c22270b69aab0d4f9e545dbecdb36a30cda22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a25ac7d8-1c7e-45dc-a3a0-5a58d6c2da00", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55c1389c7ba86cbdf2e47a7f0250c3d12cc3f0908872810d46672c5cac00b877", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cumulative  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  other\ncomprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities.

We consider restricted common stock\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\nPrior to conversion  to common stock upon our IPO, the holders of the redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would have been entitled  to dividends in\npreference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restricted\ncommon stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis\nassuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders of\nsuch shares to participate in our losses.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\npotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019\ncompensation.  The  insurance  reserves  is  the  liability  for  unpaid  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses,  which  represents  the  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid\nobligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the\nbalance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In\naddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,\nseverity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.\nAdjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settled\nwithin one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All\nestimates  of  ultimate  losses  and  allocated  loss  adjustment  expenses,  and  of  resulting  reserves,  are  subject  to  inherent  variability  caused  by  the  nature  of  the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the\nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory,  indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when\nwe believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\n94\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.

Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.\nDidi Investment\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

These observed inputs\nwere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was\napplied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of\nCOVID-19 as a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was reduced  by\n$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,\nrepresenting the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance\nsheet  and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  the\nsignificant uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was\nconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost was\nconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.\nThe fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by the\ninvestee during that quarter.

As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from\nCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was\nless than their carrying value.\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,\nweighted  at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individual\nsecurities within the investees\u2019 capital structure  based on contractual  rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed\nmarket valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities\noccurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are\nconsidered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the\nlatest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.\nA lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of\nallocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would\nresult in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and\nmacro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we\nrecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

The reduction of our\nownership interest to 20% in SDG, initially valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.\n2021\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and we\nwould sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d). Subsequent to the Initial Closing,\nYandex  spun-off,  by  way  of  demerger  from  MLU  B.V.,  its  delivery  businesses:  Yandex.Eats,  Yandex.Lavka  and  Yandex.Delivery  (collectively,  \u201cDemerged\nBusinesses\u201d).  Immediately  following  the  demerger,  Yandex  acquired  all  of  our  equity  interest  in  the  Demerged  Businesses  (\u201cDemerger  Share  Closing\u201d).  In\nconnection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an option (\u201cMLU B.V. Call Option\u201d) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during\nthe two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i)\n$276 million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLU\nB.V. Call Option; and (iv) the remaining immaterial amounts to our interest in SDG.\nInitial Closing\nDuring the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of equity\ninterest in MLU B.V. to Yandex. At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in other\nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. The consideration\n(1)\n(1) \n103\nallocated and gains recognized for the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG were not material.\nDemerger Share Closing\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, MLU B.V. completed the spin-off of the Demerger Businesses and Yandex\nacquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses. As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized a\ngain of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\nMLU B.V.

Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate\nshare of the net assets of MLU B.V.

The equity\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\nSenior Notes\nIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-\nyear notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November 1, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement offering totaling $2.0\nbillion.

The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring\nentity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or\ntype of business performed for the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in\nwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success on\nthe merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\nSwiss Social Security Reclassification\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of\nUber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a\nruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations\nB.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as\ndependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has\nno impact on our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for this\nmatter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v.

Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that\nthey should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage\nwhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a\nsettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for\na settlement  of historical  holiday pay  and national  minimum  wage liabilities  closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended  offers to all drivers  eligible  for\nsettlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place\nin 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and\nholiday pay.\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these\nmatters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n128\nOther Driver Classification Matters\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,\nadministrative  actions,  and  government  investigations  and  audits  challenging  our classification  of Drivers  as independent  contractors  and  not  employees.  We\nbelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nHowever, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could\nhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these\nmatters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other\nfactors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nIn  2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  for\npurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,\nagainst both Rasier and Uber.

Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\nOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach of\ntheir respective employment agreements with Google, fraud and other state law violations (due to soliciting Google employees and starting a new venture to\ncompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google\non behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.\nWhether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.\nIn March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from the\ntrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed to\nperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that is\nscheduled for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matter\nwithin accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with\nregard to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well as\nthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve\nthe  applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  on\npayments made to such Drivers.\nWe are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider.

The assets and\noperations in Qatar and Morocco (collectively \u201cNon-Transferred Countries\u201d) had not yet been transferred to us as of December 31, 2020. The purpose of the\nCareem Qatar and Morocco\u2019s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing services in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-\nTransferred Countries were not transferred as of December 31, 2020, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries\nwhich was considered a variable interest. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through the\nright to all  of the proceeds from  either  the divestiture  or the  eventual  legal  transfer  upon regulatory  approval  of the entities  comprising  the Non-Transferred\nCountries. We controlled Intellectual Properties (\u201cIP\u201d) which are significant for the business of Non-Transferred Countries and sub-license those IP to the Non-\nTransferred Countries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of the\nentities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries. As a result, we consolidated the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries as of December 31, 2020.\nOn September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem\u2019s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. Transfer of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar will\nbe subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval.

We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from either the divestiture or the\neventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity. As a result, we consolidated Careem Qatar as of December 31, 2021.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that\nmost  significantly  impact  the  entities\u2019  economic  performance.

We\nwere exposed to CS-Mexico\u2019s economic  risks and rewards through: the CS-Mexico Put/Call;  an immaterial  unsecured note; the contractual  rights to 35% of\ncontingent sale proceeds from CS-Mexico under certain conditions; and a market-based fee related to the transition services agreement, all of which represented\nvariable interests held by Uber. However, we were not the primary beneficiary and we did not consolidate CS-Mexico.\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, Cornershop Global\n(\u201cCS-Global\u201d), an entity which held all of Cornershop business operations, except for those in Mexico,\n131\nexercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. We owned 55% of CS-Mexico through our ownership in CS-Global.\nThe acquisition of CS-Mexico by CS-Global triggered a reconsideration event and we reevaluated if CS-Mexico still met the definition of a VIE. As of December\n31, 2021, we determined that CS-Mexico was no longer a VIE when it was acquired by CS-Global, which has sufficient equity to operate without the need for\nsubordinated financial support.

We were exposed to Aurora\u2019s economic risks and rewards through our equity interests, which represented variable interests. On November 3,\n2021, Aurora completed its planned SPAC merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, making Aurora a publicly traded company post combination, which\ntriggered a reconsideration event.

The Initial Cornershop\nInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownership\npercentage, the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount.

The loss was included in other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition  of the remaining  45% ownership interest  in Cornershop (or 47%, on a fully-diluted  basis) in an all-stock\ntransaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.

The acquisition date fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred for Transplace was $2.3 billion.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\nFair Value\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n29 \nAccounts receivable, net\n899 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n23 \nProperty and equipment, net\n44 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n57 \nIntangible assets, net\n902 \nGoodwill\n1,438 \nOther assets\n3 \nTotal assets acquired\n3,395 \nAccounts payable\n(516)\nOperating lease liabilities, current\n(7)\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n(363)\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current\n(66)\nDeferred tax liability\n(163)\nOther long-term liabilities\n(1)\nTotal liabilities assumed\n(1,116)\nNet assets acquired\n$\n2,279 \nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is\nprimarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Transplace and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was assigned to our Freight segment. The fair values\nassigned  to  tangible  and  identifiable  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  are  based  on  management\u2019s  estimates  and  assumptions  at  the  time  of\nacquisition.

However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\n\u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that\nassessment,  our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred.
